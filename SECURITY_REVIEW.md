# Security Review Report

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security review conducted on the Apartment Voting System. The application demonstrates strong security practices with several areas for improvement.

## Security Findings

### ‚úÖ Strong Security Measures

1. **Session Management**
   - Secure session cookies with httpOnly, secure, and sameSite attributes
   - Session rotation after 12 hours for enhanced security
   - Proper session expiration and cleanup
   - In-memory session store with automatic cleanup

2. **Input Validation**
   - Comprehensive Zod validation schemas for all inputs
   - Email format validation with regex
   - Password complexity requirements
   - HTML sanitization functions
   - Apartment unit format validation

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
   - Role-based access control
   - Session-based authentication
   - Login attempt tracking and security logging

4. **Encryption**
   - AES-256-CBC encryption for sensitive data
   - Proper key derivation with scrypt
   - Secure random token generation

5. **Audit & Security Logging**
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Security event tracking
   - IP address and user agent logging

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Issues Found & Fixed

1. **CORS Configuration (FIXED)**
   - **Issue**: Socket.IO CORS was set to "*" allowing any origin
   - **Fix**: Updated to use environment-based allowed origins
   - **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests

2. **In-Memory Session Store (MEDIUM RISK)**
   - **Issue**: Sessions stored in memory (lost on restart)
   - **Recommendation**: Use Redis or database for production
   - **Mitigation**: Current implementation is acceptable for development

### üîí Security Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-256-bit-hex-key
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://app.yourdomain.com
   DATABASE_URL=your-secure-database-url
   ```

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Use Redis for session storage
   - Implement rate limiting middleware
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Enable Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Use HTTPS everywhere

3. **Additional Security Measures**
   - Implement 2FA for admin accounts
   - Add rate limiting to API endpoints
   - Implement account lockout after failed attempts
   - Add email verification for registration
   - Implement password reset functionality

4. **Database Security**
   - Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
   - Implement database connection encryption
   - Regular database backups
   - Audit database access

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Password Security**
   - Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
   - bcrypt hashing with salt
   - No password storage in plain text

2. **Session Security**
   - HttpOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks
   - Secure flag for HTTPS only
   - SameSite strict prevents CSRF
   - Session rotation prevents session fixation

3. **Input Validation**
   - Server-side validation for all inputs
   - SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM
   - XSS prevention through HTML sanitization
   - Type safety with TypeScript and Zod

4. **Error Handling**
   - Generic error messages for authentication failures
   - Detailed error logging for debugging
   - No sensitive information in error responses

## Compliance & Standards

The application follows industry security standards:
- OWASP Top 10 mitigation
- GDPR compliance considerations
- Secure coding practices
- Defense in depth approach

## Conclusion

The Apartment Voting System demonstrates a strong security foundation with proper authentication, session management, and input validation. The primary security concern (CORS configuration) has been addressed. For production deployment, consider implementing the recommended additional security measures.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy with environment variables configured
2. Implement Redis for session storage
3. Add rate limiting middleware
4. Conduct penetration testing
5. Regular security audits and updates
