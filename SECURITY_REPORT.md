## 🚨 Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. **CVE-2024-XXXX: Weak Cryptographic Implementation**
**Risk Level: CRITICAL**
- **Issue**: Deprecated `createCipher` instead of `createCipheriv`
- **Fix**: Implemented proper AES-256-CBC with IV and key derivation
- **Location**: `/src/lib/crypto.ts`
- **Impact**: Prevents cryptographic attacks and ensures data confidentiality

### 2. **CVE-2024-XXXX: No Rate Limiting**
**Risk Level: HIGH**
- **Issue**: No protection against brute force attacks
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive rate limiting system
- **Location**: `/src/lib/rate-limit.ts`
- **Impact**: Prevents brute force, DoS, and automated attacks

### 3. **CVE-2024-XXXX: Input Validation Bypass**
**Risk Level: HIGH**
- **Issue**: No proper input validation and sanitization
- **Fix**: Implemented Zod-based validation with sanitization
- **Location**: `/src/lib/validation.ts`
- **Impact**: Prevents injection attacks and data corruption

### 4. **CVE-2024-XXXX: Insecure Session Management**
**Risk Level: HIGH**
- **Issue**: Weak session handling with no rotation
- **Fix**: Secure session management with rotation and validation
- **Location**: `/src/lib/session.ts`
- **Impact**: Prevents session hijacking and fixation attacks

### 5. **CVE-2024-XXXX: Missing Security Headers**
**Risk Level: MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: No security headers implemented
- **Fix**: Comprehensive security headers implementation
- **Location**: `/src/lib/middleware.ts`
- **Impact**: Prevents XSS, clickjacking, and other client-side attacks
